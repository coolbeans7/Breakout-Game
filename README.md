The-Best-Breakout-Game
======================

Unity

Notes: Weird Javascript, gotta try the C# stuff. Need to study more API docs. The demo that was loaded was amazing so lots of coolness there. Variables can be declared like so 

var ballPrefab:GameObject; // to be exposed in the GUI and are required to be set to compile
var attachedBall:GameObject = null; // to be used later in code

Must remember to remove gravity on bouncy objects.

More for later...
